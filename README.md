This tool just helps me understand and implement SSL/TLS in C. Several code snippets
were found in [Implementing SSL/TLS using Cryptography and PKI](http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470920416.html).
This tool is **not** ready for production.

## Compile & Run

    $ make
    $ ./ssl-tls --help
